# Rusted_Memory

A repository made to showcase my math projects & libraries made in rust.

## Description

I make a lot of math libraries & utilities, and they should all be here for free download and use.
I tend to seperate things into individual libraries; feel free to download them and use them in your own code <sup>with credit ofcourse</sup>.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Rust Version 1.81.0 (2024-09-05) or higher
* Rustup Version 1.27.0 - 2024-03-08
* Cargo 1.81.0 (2dbb1af80 2024-08-20) or higher
* Git 2.46.4 or higher

### Installing

* Open a command-line program such as:
    * Powershell
    * Cmd
    * Terminal
* Clone using Git
```
git clone https://github.com/Xtrau505/Rusted_Memory.git
```

### Executing program (Built from source)

* Enter the project directory
```
cd ./Rusted_Memory
```
* Build using Cargo
   * If Cargo isnt installed:
       * Windows:
           * Open your web browser of choice.
           * Go to [https://win.rustup.rs/](https://win.rustup.rs/), and download the .exe
           * Execute the file (rustup-init.exe)
           * Open your command line of choice
           * Type `rustup --version` to see if rustup is installed.
           * If done correctly, you have now installed Cargo!
       * Linux/MacOS
           * Open your command line of choice
           * Execute the command `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
           * Execute the command `rustup --version`
           * If done correctly, you have now installed Cargo!
```
cargo build --release
```
* Run the program
```
./target/release/Rusted_Memory
```

## Help

If you come across any troubles building, first see if:
* Your cargo version is up to date
* Your operating system is supported (Windows & Linux are)

If problems persist, [open an issue](https://github.com/Xtrau505/Rusted_Memory/issues).
